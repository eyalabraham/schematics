# VGA color display car
Video display card will mimic MDA 80x25 8 color text mode on a standard 640x480 VGA.
Use R6545E display address generator/controller (CRTC) with 4KB RAM.
This solution was not implemented and it is here just for reference.

**VGA signals**
- HSYNC/VSYNC are TTL signals
- RED/GREEN/BLUE are 0.7V peak-to-peak (0V for black level, 0.7V for full color intensity).

**Hardware design**

**R6545E programming**
Monochrome character mode 80x40 characters, each character 8-pixels wide by 12-pixels high
- R0 = 99           total horizontal character (bytes) minus 1
- R1 = 80           horizontal displayed characters (bytes)
- R2 = 82           horizontal sync position
- R3 = 44 / 0x2C    v and h sync width
- R4 = 42           total vertical rows minus 1, int(525/12)-1
- R5 = 9            9 scan lines to adjust to 525 scan lines in VGA standard
- R6 = 40           displayed character rows
- R7 = 41           v-sync position
- R8 = 0b01001000   CRTC mode (see page 2-67)
- R9 = 11           scan lines per character minus 1
- R10 = 0b01100000  cursor start line and blink rate
- R11 = 0b00001011  cursor end scan line

Monochrome graphics mode 640x408 pixels
Configure as character mode with 80x51 characters, each character 8 scan lines high
- R0 = 99           total horizontal character (bytes) minus 1 (800 pixels total)

- R3 = 44 / 0x2C    v and h sync width
- R4 = 64           total vertical rows minus 1, int(525/8)-1
- R5 = 5            5 scan lines to adjust to 525 scan lines in VGA standard
- R6 = 51           displayed character rows
- R7 = 61           v-sync position
- R8 = 0b01001000   CRTC mode (see page 2-67)

For graphics display Video memory will be driven by RA2,RA1,RA0,MA11...MA0 -> A14...A00, and VRAM data bytes are sent directly to serializer without going through the ROM character generator.
This VRAM address bus arrangement creates eight (8) interleaved buffers 4,080 bytes each at the following addresses:

| Bank | Start | End   |
|------|-------|-------|
| 0    | $0000 | $0FEF |
| 1    | $1000 | $1FEF |
| 2    | $2000 | $2FEF |
| 3    | $3000 | $3FEF |
| 4    | $4000 | $4FEF |
| 5    | $5000 | $5FEF |
| 6    | $6000 | $6FEF |
| 7    | $7000 | $7FEF |
